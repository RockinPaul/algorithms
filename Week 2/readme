Week 2 - Portuguese Pavements

Problem

The company "Nova Calçada Portuguesa" designs contemporaneous portuguese pavements, with black and white stones, for large pedestrian areas by following a simple mathematical aesthetic principle.

The design of the pavement is based a squared boolean matrix, where each entry corresponds to a stone. If an entry in the matrix is false, then the corresponding stone is white, otherwise, is black. The matrices are build with two parameters, N and R. Given a non-negative integer N, the matrix has size 2N. For N=0, the matrix has only one entry with value false. For R=0, a matrix for a given positive N is obtaining by aligning 4 copies of a matrix for N-1, and then negating the values in the lower right matrix. This rule changes for a positive R: the negation occurs in the lower right matrix shifted R times in the counterclockwise direction.

The following figure illustrates how a matrix for N=3 (for R=0) can be obtained from another matrix for N=2, where 1 means true and 0 means false.

0011|0011
0110|0110
---------
0000|1111
0101|1010
0011|1100
0110|1001


The following shows for R=6:

1001|0110
0011|1100
0101|1010
1111|0000
---------
0110|0110
1100|1100
1010|1010
0000|0000

Clearly, the designers cannot do it by hand, so they decided to call you to make a program that computes such matrix for a given N and R.


Input

Each line corresponds to a test case with the values of N and R.


Output

Print the resulting matrix where 1 corresponds to true and 0 corresponds to false.
Note: Code with hard-coded matrices for several values of N will not be considered as accepted.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10 and 0 ≤R ≤ 1000.
