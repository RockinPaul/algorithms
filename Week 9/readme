Problem

You are working as a programmer in a railway company. Your duty is to write a
software that generates personalized train timetables to users of the company's web
system. Everything is going fine until suddenly you drop the coffee into the server that
contains the complete trains schedule database .. time to panic! You have only time to
print the contents of a table in the database that contains the assignment of trains to
train stations. Then, PUM! .. the server blows up! And you do not even know if the data
printed is not corrupted!
Now you have an herculean task: Given several pairs of numbers printed in the sheet
of paper that, eventually, correspond to the assignment of trains to train stations, you
have to find out whether this data is corrupted or not. Clearly, it is corrupted if a pair of
numbers corresponds to two trains or two train stations.. how to find this?

Constraints
n ≤ 500 
m ≤ 65 000 

Output
The output for each test case is a line containing "NO" if the data is corrupted and
"NOT SURE" otherwise.
