Problem I 足 Scientists

Description
Your brother is a scientist at CERN and his doing weird calculations about area and
perimeter of rectangles in the plane. In particular, he wants to find a closed formula for
the ratio between the area and the perimeter of the union of a set of rectangles
randomly located in the plane, as they may help him to speed足up the calculations of the
Large Hadron Collider.
However, your brother does not know how to program, so he needs your help to
perform simulations. First, your program generates hundreds of rectangles randomly
located in the plane and consider their union. Then, it should compute the area and
perimeter of the union of these rectangles. That's quite simple for you, right?

Input

Each test case gives the location of several rectangles on the plane. Each line
describes the coordinates of the rectangle, that is, the coordinates (integer values) of
the top足right corner and bottom足left corner. The plane ranges from 0 to 215 and there
are no repeated coordinates. There are no more than one thousand rectangles.

Output

For each test case, output the total area and total perimeter of the union of the
rectangles.


Example input:
1 7 6 15
3 17 8 19
4 1 12 13
7 7 17 20
14 4 17 12
10 14 14 18
11 2 15 5

Example output:
249 90
