Problem J Â­ Polygons have ears!

Description
A simple polygon has an ear at vertex v if the triangle formed by v and its two adjacent
vertices shares two edges with the polygon and the other edge lies completely in the
interior of the polygon.

For a given simple polygon (the edges do not cross), your goal is to count how many
ears exist.

Input

There is a single test case per input file. The first line of each test case contains an
integer n indicating the number of vertices of the polygon. Each of the next n lines
contains the coordinates of a vertex. The vertices are sorted clockwise.
We assume that the polygon has no holes, is closed and there exist no three adjacent
points that are colinear.

Output

The output is the number of ears for each test case.


Example input:
5
1 2
2 3
1 4
5 5
5 1

Example output:
4
